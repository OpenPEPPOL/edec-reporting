= Introduction

End User reporting of production data helps the Peppol Coordinating Authority and PAs to monitor the operations of the Peppol Network and identify and manage risks and issues within the network.
The reporting requirements towards SPs are divided into two areas: reporting about End User data and reporting about Transaction Statistics. This operational procedure will explain and outline the operational procedures for the End User Reporting.
The policy on reporting is stated in Internal Regulations for Use of the Peppol Network.
