= EndUser
Defines the data for a single end user.

== Legal ID
The element `LegalID` MUST contain the Legal Identifier of the reporting organisation.
Legal identifier of the End User in the jurisdiction within which it is legally based, 
and legal identifier Type (e.g., VAT number, company registration number).
a. The legal identifier has to be active, in jurisdictions when such distinction exists.
 b. In case of End Users that are public organisations and where legal identifiers as 
    such do not exist, other officially issued codes are acceptable.
    The schemeID does not follow a code list. If possible, the values of the Peppol
    Participant Identifier Scheme Code List SHOULD be used (like "9914" for an
    Austrian VAT number).
