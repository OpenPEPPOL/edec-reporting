== Data Gathering

* Reporting Period
** The Reporting Period starts with the first day of every month at 
   00:00:00 UTC (inclusive) and ends with the last day of said month
   at 23:59:59 UTC (inclusive).

* Data
** Only Service Providers offering the exchange of Dataset Types MUST
   gather this data and transmit as an End User Report.
** Only Data for production MUST be sent.
** The following data elements MUST be provided for each End User Report
*** Number of users that have sent a dataset
*** Number of end users that have received a dataset
*** Peppol Dataset Type (Document Type ID) and Profile ID (Process ID)


** Only Dataset exchanges that resulted in a positive transport level
acknowledgments (like AS4 Receipts) MUST be included in the End User Report.
Transmissions that failed on a network or protocol
level MUST NOT to be considered for the report.
*** End User Reports MUST NOT be counted for an End User Report.
*** Transaction Statistics Reports themselves MUST NOT be counted for an End User Report.

== Data Aggregation

Before the End User Report data is transmitted to OpenPeppol it needs to be aggregated. The aggregation
can be performed on any of the above-mentioned osurce fields defined by the Internal Regulations.

The following aggregations MUST be provided to be compliant with this specification.

* The Dataset Type and Process ID.


== Data Transmission

* Frequency
** An End User Report MUST be transmitted once per month 
   (Reporting Period)
** An End User Report MUST be transmitted within 10 calendar days 
   (inclusive) after the end of the previous Reporting Period
** The End User Report must be transmitted, even if no other Peppol
   transactions happened in the Reporting Period.
** In case the End User Report of one Service Provider is received
   multiple times for one Reporting Period, only the latest received 
   document will be processed.
** End User Reports received after the deadline WILL NOT be processed.   

* Data
** Only End User Reports on the Production environment MUST be transmitted
** Each aggregation per Dataset Type and Process ID pair MUST NOT occur more than once in an End User Report.
** The Reporting Period MUST be part of the End User Report.
** An identifier uniquely identifying the reporting Service Provider
   MUST be part of the End User Report.

* Network
** End User Reports MUST be transmitted via the Peppol eDelivery
   Network
** Only OpenPeppol is allowed to receive End User Reports directly
