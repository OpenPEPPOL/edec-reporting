:leveloffset: +1

= Introduction

End User reporting of production data helps the Peppol Coordinating Authority and PAs to monitor the operations of the Peppol Network and identify and manage risks and issues within the network.
The reporting requirements towards SPs are divided into two areas: reporting about End User data and reporting about Transaction Statistics. This operational procedure will explain and outline the operational procedures for the End User Reporting.
The policy on reporting is stated in https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AF/pages/2756771841/New+Peppol+Agreements+and+accompanying+documents#B2.-Internal-Regulations-on-the-Use-of-the-Peppol-Network[Internal Regulations for Use of the Peppol Network].

== Document Structure

This document is structured as follows:

NOTE: TODO

* **Chapter 1** (Introduction) - provides general informations about End User Reporting business process.
* **Chapter 2** (= Reporting Business Process) - provides the reader with information on how to implement the End User Reporting process.
* **Chapter 3** (Business Information) - provides the reader with functional information for the End User Reporting Process.
* **Chapter 4** (Rules) - provides the reader with information on the business rules to be respected for the End User Reporting Process.

* Technical Details

   Provide the reader with information on the technical aspects for the implementation of the End User Reporting Process.


== Scope

//NOTE: Add what is in scope explicitly it can be just a paragraph

This document sets out the processes and procedure for End User reporting process including:

.	Parties and Roles,

= Reporting Business Process

== Parties and Roles

//NOTE: add the main parties of the *Business Process*. The party is the service provider on the role of reporter and the Peppol OO as the report receiver
:leveloffset: +1
The following roles may be specified. 
//The same actor may play more than one role depending on the handling routine.

//Further details on the roles/actors can be found in <<roles>>.

== Service Provider (SP) 

Service Provider  is mandatory information and provided in element 

`eur:EndUserReport / eur:Header / eur:ReporterID`

.EUR example of Service Provider information
[source, xml, indent=0]

    <ReporterID schemeID="CertSubjectCN">POP000360</ReporterID>


. Service Provider  schemeID (IBT-060-1), mandatory, the identification scheme identifier shall be chosen from the entries of the list published by the https://www.iso.org/standard/25773.html[ISO/IEC 6523] maintenance agency.
. ReporterID (IBT-060) the value of the Peppol AP Certificate Subject CN (Common Name) to uniquely identify the Service Provider that is providing the data.

SPs will:

* Collect relevant data, taking care with the accuracy and validity of this data.
*	Report this data in accordance to this document. This interface allows for a standardized and structured dataset from where the Peppol Coordinating Authority can automate processing and aggregation of the data upon receival in the Peppol Reporting Platform.
* Ensure all data for a month is reported within 10 calendar days following the end of the month.
* Transmit the Peppol End User Report BIS to the Peppol Coordinating Authority in accordance with this specification.

== OpenPeppol Operating Office (OO)

operating Office is mandatory information and provided in element ` ?????`

.EUR example of Operating Office information
[source, xml, indent=0]
<ProfileID>urn:fdc:peppol.eu:oo:bis:reporting:1</ProfileID> 

NOTE: to be corrected

. Operating Office identifier  (IBT-002), identifies the business process context in which the transaction appears, to enable the receiver to process the document in an appropriate way.
//<2> Buyer identifier (ibt-046), if used, the identification scheme identifier shall be chosen from the entries of the list published by the ISO/IEC 6523 maintenance agency.

The OpenPeppol Operating Office (OO) will:

* Automatically check which providers have not submitted their End User Report. This check will be triggered automatically.
* Prompt any SPs that have not submitted the End User Report.
* Prompting will be done by email and not by eDelivery
* Define that in due time is supposed to be 5 days, giving it a total of 15 days
* Prompt the PA of the SP if a SP fails to submit the End User Report in due time after reminders are sent. The PA of the SP will be informed to handle this as a non-compliance issue.
* Failure by SPs to provide full and complete reports can be managed in accordance with the https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AF/pages/2756771841/New+Peppol+Agreements+and+accompanying+documents#B3.-Operational-Procedures[Non-compliance Operational Procedure].
