This operational procedure will explain and outline the operational procedures for the Transaction statistics Reporting. The policy on reporting is stated in Internal Regulations for Use of the Peppol Network.

<ProfileID>urn:fdc:peppol.eu:oo:bis:reporting:1</ProfileID> 

NOTE: to be corrected

. Operating Office identifier  (IBT-002), identifies the business process context in which the transaction appears, to enable the receiver to process the document in an appropriate way.

The OpenPeppol Operating Office (OO) will:

* Automatically check which providers have not submitted their Transaction Statistics Report. This check will be triggered automatically.
* Prompt any SPs that have not submitted the Transaction Statistics Report.
* Prompting will be done by email and not by eDelivery
* Define that in due time is supposed to be 5 days, giving it a total of 15 days

* Failure by SPs to provide full and complete reports can be managed in accordance with the https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AF/pages/2756771841/New+Peppol+Agreements+and+accompanying+documents#B3.-Operational-Procedures[Non-compliance Operational Procedure].

- If a Service Provider initiates its Peppol activities during a reporting period, this particular reporting period starts for this Service Provider at the initiation point in time.
- If a Service Provider ends its Peppol activities during a reporting period, this particular reporting period ends for this Service Provider at the ending point in time. The report must be send anyway.
- Only Service Providers offering the exchange of Dataset Types must fill out and transmit Transaction Statistics
Data for test and production must be gathered separately
- All outgoing datasets to which a positive transport level acknowledgment was received must be counted ("outgoing countable dataset")
- All incoming datasets to which a positivie transport level acknowledgement was sent must be be counted ("incoming countable dataset")




=== Data Aggregation
