= Transaction statistics Reporting Process

The following diagrams provide an overview of the key steps when 
Service Providers are reporting monthly Transaction Statistics:

== Data Gathering

* Reporting Period
// [Jerry] This is my approach on different reporting periods
** A monthly Reporting Period starts with the first day of every month at 
   00:00:00 UTC (inclusive) and ends with the last day of said month
   at 23:59:59 UTC (inclusive).
** A quarterly Reporting Period starts with the first day of a month at 
   00:00:00 UTC (inclusive) and ends with the last day of the month after next at 23:59:59 UTC (inclusive).
* Data
** Only Service Providers operating a production Peppol Access Point must gather this data and
transmit a Transaction Statistics Report.
** Only data for production MUST be sent.
** According to the Internal Regulations (IR), chapter 4.4, the following
   information elements need to be gathered for each exchanged Dataset:
    1. Timing of the exchange
    2. Direction of the exchange (incoming or outgoing)
    3. Sending Peppol Service Provider
    4. Receiving Peppol Service Provider
// NOTE: Process ID was deliberately left out in order to ensure
//       alignment with the IR
    5. Peppol Dataset Type (Document Type ID)
    6. Transport protocol used
// NOTE: CC's need to be optional
    7. Country of sender *
    8. Country of receiver *

** Only Dataset exchanges that resulted in a positive transport level
   acknowledgment (like AS4 Receipts) MUST be included in the Transaction
   Statistics Report. Transmissions that failed on a network or protocol
   level MUST NOT to be considered for the report.
*** End User Statistics Reports MUST NOT be counted for a Transaction Statistics Report
*** Transaction Statistics Reports MUST NOT be counted for a Transaction Statistics Report
*** Each message MUST be counted only once by a SP (incoming or outgoing), it MUST NOT be counted twice.

// TODO agree with JD
NOTE: * The Country of the sender and receiver will be mandatory, when the backing eDEC specifications become mandatory


== Data Aggregation

Before the Transaction Statistics Report data is transmitted to OpenPeppol
  it needs to be aggregated. The aggregation can be performed on any of the
  above-mentioned source fields defined by the Internal Regulations.
  
The following aggregations MUST be provided to be compliant to this specification:

* Transport Protocol
* Service Provider, Dataset Type and Process ID

The following aggregations MAY be provided to be compliant to this specification:

* Service Provider, Dataset Type, Process ID, Sender Country and Receiver Country

== Data Transmission

// TODO needed
// Elaboration on Business Requirements (see Philip's Excel file) on Data Transmission

* Frequency
// [Jerry] can we leave it like this?
** A Transaction Statistics Report MUST be transmitted once per month or once per quarter (Reporting Period)
** A Transaction Statistics Report MUST be transmitted within 10 calendar days 
   (inclusive) after the end of the previous Reporting Period
** The Transaction Statistics Report MUST be transmitted, even if no other Peppol
   exchange happened in the Reporting Period
** In case the Transaction Statistics Report of one Service Provider is received
   multiple times for one Reporting Period, only the latest received 
   document will be processed.
** Transaction Statistics Reports received after the deadline WILL NOT be processed.   

* Data
** Only Transaction Statistics Reports on the Production environment MUST be transmitted
** Each Transaction Statistics MUST NOT occur more than once in a 
   Transaction Statistics Report
** The data of each Transaction Statistics must be reported in the designated
   elements
** The Reporting Period MUST be part of the Transaction Statistics Report
** An identifier uniquely identifying the reporting Service Provider 
   MUST be part of the Transaction Statistics Report

* Network
** Transaction Statistics Reports must be transmitted via the Peppol eDelivery
   Network
** Only OpenPeppol is allowed to receive Transaction Statistics Reports directly
