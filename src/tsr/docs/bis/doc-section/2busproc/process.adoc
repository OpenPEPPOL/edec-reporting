== Data Gathering

* Reporting Period
** The exact length of a Reporting Period is defined external to this document.
** A Reporting Period starts at 00:00:00 UTC (inclusive) of the first day.
** A Reporting Period ends at 23:59:59 UTC (inclusive) of the last day.

* Data
** Only Service Providers operating a production Peppol Access Point MUST gather this data and transmit a Transaction Statistics Report.
** Only data for the production network MUST be gathered.
** According to the Internal Regulations (IR), chapter 4.4, the following information elements need to be gathered for each exchanged Dataset:
    1. Timing of the exchange
    2. Direction of the exchange (incoming or outgoing)
    3. Sending Peppol Service Provider
    4. Receiving Peppol Service Provider
// NOTE: Process ID was deliberately left out in order to ensure alignment with the IR
    5. Peppol Dataset Type (Document Type ID)
    6. Transport protocol used
// NOTE: CC's need to be optional
    7. Country of sender *
    8. Country of receiver *

** Only Dataset exchanges that resulted in a positive transport level
   acknowledgment (like AS4 Receipts) MUST be included in the Transaction
   Statistics Report. Transmissions that failed on a network or protocol
   level MUST NOT to be considered for the report.
** End User Statistics Reports MUST NOT be counted for a Transaction Statistics Report
** Transaction Statistics Reports MUST NOT be counted for a Transaction Statistics Report
** Only the sending SP MUST count the message as 'outgoing' and only the receiving SP MUST count the same message as 'incoming'.

// TODO agree with JD
NOTE: * The Country of the sender and receiver will be mandatory, when the backing eDEC specifications become mandatory


== Data Aggregation

Before the Transaction Statistics Report data is transmitted to OpenPeppol
  it needs to be aggregated. The aggregation can be performed on any of the
  above-mentioned source fields defined by the Internal Regulations.
  
The following aggregations MUST be provided to be compliant to this specification:

* Transport Protocol
* Service Provider, Dataset Type ID and Process ID

The following aggregations MAY be provided to be compliant to this specification:

* Service Provider, Dataset Type ID, Process ID, Sender Country and Receiver Country

== Data Transmission

* Frequency
** A Transaction Statistics Report MUST be transmitted once per Reporting Period.
** A Transaction Statistics Report MUST be transmitted within 10 calendar days (inclusive) after the end of the previous Reporting Period.
** The Transaction Statistics Report MUST be transmitted, even if no other Peppol exchange happened in the Reporting Period.
** In case the Transaction Statistics Report of one Service Provider is received multiple times for one Reporting Period, only the latest received document will be processed.
** Transaction Statistics Reports received after the deadline WILL NOT be processed.   

* Data
** Only Transaction Statistics Reports on the Production environment MUST be transmitted.
** Each Transaction Statistics MUST NOT occur more than once in a Transaction Statistics Report.
** The data of each Transaction Statistics MUST be reported in the designated elements.
** The Reporting Period MUST be part of the Transaction Statistics Report.
** An identifier uniquely identifying the reporting Service Provider.
   MUST be part of the Transaction Statistics Report.

* Network
** Transaction Statistics Reports MUST be transmitted via the Peppol eDelivery Network.
** Only OpenPeppol is allowed to receive Transaction Statistics Reports directly.
