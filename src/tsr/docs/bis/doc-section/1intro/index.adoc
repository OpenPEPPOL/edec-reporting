= Introduction

Transaction Statistics reporting of production data helps OpenPeppol as the Peppol Coordinating Authority (PCA) and 
 Peppol Authorities (PAs) to monitor the operations of the Peppol Network and identify and manage risks and issues within the network.
The reporting requirements towards Service Providers (SPs) are divided into two areas: 
 reporting about End User Statistics and reporting about Transaction Statistics. 
This document will explain and outline the procedures for the Transaction Statistics Reporting.
The policy on reporting is stated in https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AF/pages/2891251733/Peppol+Interoperability+Framework+1+Juy+2022[Internal Regulations for Use of the Peppol Network].
