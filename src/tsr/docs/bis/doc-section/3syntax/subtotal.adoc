= Subtotals

Each Transaction Statistics Report contains different subtotals.
Each subtotal represents a different view on the transaction statistics data.

The technical representation of the subtotals was designed in a generic way,
  to allow for future extension without modifying the underlying schema.
  Each `Subtotal` element therefore requires a `@type` attribute that defines
  the type of the subtotal. The value range is defined by the
  <<codelist-subtotaltype>> code list.

Subtotals without any matching transaction (i.e. if `Incoming` is `0` and if `Outgoing` is `0`) 
  MUST NOT be part of the Report.

All values in this subchapter are case-sensitive, except stated otherwise.

== Subtotal per Transport Protocol

This subtotal is identified by the `@type` attribute having the value `PerTP`.

* This subtotal requires one `Key` element with a Meta Scheme ID of `TP`
  (Transport Protocol).
The `schemeID` attribute of this `Key` element MUST have the value `Peppol`.
The value of the `Key` element MUST be the transport protocol identifier
  according to the <<codelist-tp>> code list.
  
Each Transport Protocol MUST be reported in a separate `Subtotal` element.

The sum all incoming amounts per Transport Protocol MUST match the total
  incoming amount. 

The sum all outgoing amounts per Transport Protocol MUST match the total
  outgoing amount.

== Subtotal per Service Provider, Dataset Type and Process ID

This subtotal is identified by the `@type` attribute having the value `PerSP-DT-PR`.

* This subtotal requires one `Key` element with a Meta Scheme ID of `SP`
  (Service Provider).
The `schemeID` attribute of this `Key` element MUST have a value according
  to the <<codelist-repidscheme>> code list.
The value of the `Key` element MUST follow the rules of the chosen scheme.
* This subtotal requires one `Key` element with a Meta Scheme ID of `DT`
  (Dataset Type).
The `schemeID` attribute of this `Key` element MUST be the Document Type
  Identifier Scheme of the exchanged Dataset (usually `busdox-docid-qns` or `peppol-doctype-wildcard`).
The value of the `Key` element MUST be the Dataset Type (Document Type)
  Identifier value of the exchanged Dataset.
* This subtotal requires one `Key` element with a Meta Scheme ID of `PR`
  (Process ID).
The `schemeID` attribute of this `Key` element MUST be the Process Identifier
  Scheme of the process (Peppol profile) used (usually `cenbii-procid-ubl`).
The value of the `Key` element MUST be the Process ID value of the process
(Peppol profile) used.

Each combination of Service Provider, Dataset Type and Process ID MUST be
  reported in a separate `Subtotal` element.

The sum all incoming amounts per Service Provider, Dataset Type and Process ID MUST
   match the total incoming amount.

The sum all outgoing amounts per Service Provider, Dataset Type and Process ID MUST
  match the total outgoing amount.

NOTE: For outgoing messages, only the receiving SP (C3) needs to be counted. 
  For incoming messages, only the sending SP (C2) needs to be counted. 
  The other side must always be the reporting SP that is already part of the Report header data.

== Subtotal per Service Provider, Dataset Type, Process ID and Country Codes
This subtotal is identified by the `@type` attribute having the value `PerSP-DT-PR-CC`.

* This subtotal requires one `Key` element with a Meta Scheme ID of `SP`
  (Service Provider).
The `schemeID` attribute of this `Key` element MUST have a value according
  to the <<codelist-repidscheme>> code list.
The value of the `Key` element MUST follow the rules of the chosen scheme.
* This subtotal requires one `Key` element with a Meta Scheme ID of `DT`
  (Dataset Type).
The `schemeID` attribute of this `Key` element MUST be the Document Type
  Identifier Scheme of the exchanged Dataset (usually `busdox-docid-qns` or `peppol-doctype-wildcard`).
The value of the `Key` element MUST be the Dataset Type (Document Type)
  Identifier value of the exchanged Dataset.
* This subtotal requires one `Key` element with a Meta Scheme ID of `PR`
(Process ID).
The `schemeID` attribute of this `Key` element MUST be the Process Identifier
Scheme of the process (Peppol profile) used (usually `cenbii-procid-ubl`).
The value of the `Key` element MUST be the Process ID value of the process
(Peppol profile) used.
* This subtotal requires one `Key` element with a Meta Scheme ID of `CC`
  (Country Code) and the `schemeID` attribute of `SenderCountry`.
The value of the `Key` element MUST have a value according to the
  <<codelist-countrycode>> code list.
* This subtotal requires one `Key` element with a Meta Scheme ID of `CC`
  (Country Code) and the `schemeID` attribute of `ReceiverCountry`.
The value of the `Key` element MUST have a value according to the
  <<codelist-countrycode>> code list.
  
Each combination of Service Provider, Dataset Type, Process ID, Sender Country
  and Receiver Country MUST be reported in a separate `Subtotal` element.

The sum all incoming amounts per Service Provider, Dataset Type, Process ID and 
  Country Code MUST match the total incoming amount.

====
IMPORTANT: This subtotal can only be counted by receiving SPs (C3), because only those have the full data available.
  The outgoing count in this subtotal MUST always be `0`.
====

NOTE: For incoming messages, only the sending SP (C2) needs to be counted. 
  The other side must always be the reporting SP that is already part of the Report header data.
