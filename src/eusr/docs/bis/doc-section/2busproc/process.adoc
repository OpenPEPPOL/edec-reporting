= End User Statistics Reporting Process

The following diagrams provide an overview of the key steps when 
Service Providers are reporting End User Statistics:

== Data Gathering

* Reporting Period
** The exact length of a Reporting Period is defined external to this document.
** A Reporting Period starts at 00:00:00 UTC (inclusive) of the first day.
** A Reporting Period ends at 23:59:59 UTC (inclusive) of the last day.

* Data
** Only Service Providers operating a production Peppol Access Point MUST gather this data and transmit an End User Statistics Report.
** Only Data for the production network MUST be gathered.
** The following data elements MUST be provided for each End User Statistics Report
*** Number of End Users that have sent a Dataset
*** Number of End Users that have received a Dataset
*** Number of End Users that have sent or received a Dataset
*** Peppol Dataset Type (Document Type ID) and Profile ID (Process ID)
** Only Dataset exchanges that resulted in a positive transport level
acknowledgment (like AS4 Receipts) MUST be included in the End User Statistics Report.
Transmissions that failed on a network or protocol level MUST NOT to be considered for the report.
** End User Statistics Reports MUST NOT be counted for an End User Statistics Report.
** Transaction Statistics Reports MUST NOT be counted for an End User Statistics Report.
** Only the sending SP MUST count the message as 'outgoing' and only the receiving SP MUST count the same message as 'incoming'.

Note: If the same End User is represented with multiple Participant Identifiers, the data needs to be gathered per End User and NOT per Participant Identifier.

== Data Preparation

Before the End User Statistics Report data is transmitted to OpenPeppol it needs to be prepared for subsets. 
The preparation can be performed on any of the above-mentioned data elements defined by the Internal Regulations.

The following subsets MUST be prepared to be compliant with this specification.

* Dataset Type ID (Document Type ID) and Process ID

The following subsets MUST be provided for **receiving end users only** to be compliant to this specification:

* Dataset Type ID (Document Type ID) and Process ID, Country of sender and Country of receiver^*^

NOTE: ^*^ The Country of sender and receiver will be mandatory, once the backing eDEC specifications become mandatory

== Data Transmission

* Frequency
** An End User Statistics Report MUST be transmitted once per Reporting Period.
** An End User Statistics Report MUST be transmitted within 10 calendar days (inclusive) after the end of the previous Reporting Period.
** The End User Statistics Report MUST be transmitted, even if no other Peppol transactions happened in the Reporting Period.
** In case the End User Statistics Report of one Service Provider is received multiple times for one Reporting Period, only the latest received document will be processed.
** End User Statistics Reports received after the deadline WILL NOT be processed.   

* Data
** Only End User Statistics Reports on the Production environment MUST be transmitted. Data for non-production environments MUST NOT be transmitted.
** Each subset key combination MUST NOT occur more than once in an End User Statistics Report.
** The Reporting Period MUST be part of the End User Statistics Report.
** An identifier uniquely identifying the reporting Service Provider MUST be part of the End User Statistics Report.

* Network
** End User Statistics Reports MUST be transmitted via the Peppol eDelivery Network.
** Only OpenPeppol is allowed to receive End User Statistics Reports directly.
