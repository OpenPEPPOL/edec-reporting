= End User Statistics Reporting Process

The following diagrams provide an overview of the key steps when 
Service Providers are reporting End User Statistics:

== Data Gathering

* Reporting Period
// [Jerry] This is my approach on different reporting periods
** A monthly Reporting Period starts with the first day of every month at 
   00:00:00 UTC (inclusive) and ends with the last day of said month
   at 23:59:59 UTC (inclusive).
** A quarterly Reporting Period starts with the first day of a month at 
   00:00:00 UTC (inclusive) and ends with the last day of the month after next at 23:59:59 UTC (inclusive).
* Data
** Only Service Providers operating a production Peppol Access Point MUST gather this data and transmit an End User Statistics Report.
** Only Data for the production network MUST be gathered.
** The following data elements MUST be provided for each End User Statistics Report
*** Number of End Users that have sent a Dataset
*** Number of End Users that have received a Dataset
*** Peppol Dataset Type (Document Type ID) and Profile ID (Process ID)


** Only Dataset exchanges that resulted in a positive transport level
acknowledgment (like AS4 Receipts) MUST be included in the End User Statistics Report.
Transmissions that failed on a network or protocol
level MUST NOT to be considered for the report.
*** End User Statistics Reports MUST NOT be counted for an End User Statistics Report.
*** Transaction Statistics Reports MUST NOT be counted for an End User Statistics Report.
*** Each message MUST be counted only once by an SP (incoming or outgoing), it MUST NOT be counted twice.


== Data Aggregation

Before the End User Statistics Report data is transmitted to OpenPeppol it needs to be aggregated. The aggregation
can be performed on any of the above-mentioned source fields defined by the Internal Regulations.

The following aggregations MUST be provided to be compliant with this specification.

* The Dataset Type and Process ID.

== Data Transmission

* Frequency
// [Jerry] can we leave it like this?
** An End User Statistics Report MUST be transmitted once per month or once per quarter (Reporting Period).
** An End User Statistics Report MUST be transmitted within 10 calendar days (inclusive) after the end of the previous Reporting Period.
** The End User Statistics Report MUST be transmitted, even if no other Peppol transactions happened in the Reporting Period.
** In case the End User Statistics Report of one Service Provider is received multiple times for one Reporting Period, only the latest received document will be processed.
** End User Statistics Reports received after the deadline WILL NOT be processed.   

* Data
** Only End User Statistics Reports on the Production environment MUST be transmitted.
** Each aggregation per Dataset Type and Process ID pair MUST NOT occur more than once in an End User Statistics Report.
** The Reporting Period MUST be part of the End User Statistics Report.
** An identifier uniquely identifying the reporting Service Provider MUST be part of the End User Statistics Report.

* Network
** End User Statistics Reports MUST be transmitted via the Peppol eDelivery Network.
** Only OpenPeppol is allowed to receive End User Statistics Reports directly.
