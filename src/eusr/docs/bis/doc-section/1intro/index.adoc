= Introduction

End User Statistics reporting of production data helps the Peppol Coordinating Authority (PCA) and Peppol Authorities (PAs)
 to monitor the operations of the Peppol Network and identify and manage risks and issues within the network.
The reporting requirements towards Service Providers (SPs) are divided into two areas:
 reporting about End User data and reporting about Transaction Statistics.
This document will explain and outline the procedures for the End User Statistics Reporting.
The policy on reporting is stated in https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AF/pages/2891251733/Peppol+Interoperability+Framework+1+Juy+2022[Internal Regulations for Use of the Peppol Network].

// #Note: The current BIS is completely diverged from the IR. IR needs to be updated#.
