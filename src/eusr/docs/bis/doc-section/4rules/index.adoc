// Subset DT-PR

| BR-EUSR-22
| The Report MUST contain the End User Cardinality that have sent datasets during the Reporting Period,
subset by Dataset Type ID and Process ID.
| XSD

SCH-EUSR-15

subset by Dataset Type ID and Process ID.
| XSD 

SCH-EUSR-15

| BR-EUSR-24
| The Report MUST contain the End User Cardinality that have sent or received datasets during the Reporting Period,
subset by Dataset Type ID and Process ID.
