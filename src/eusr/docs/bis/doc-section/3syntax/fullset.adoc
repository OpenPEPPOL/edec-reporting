= Full Set Information

Defines the overall amount of end users that have exchanged datasets in the Reporting Period.
The element `FullSet` and its child elements MUST be provided for every End User Statistics Report.

The element `eusr:FullSet/eusr:SendingEndUsers` contains the overall number of distinct end users that
have sent datasets. Only values &ge; 0 are allowed.

The element `eusr:FullSet/eusr:ReceivingEndUsers` contains the overall number of distinct end users that
have received datasets. Only values &ge; 0 are allowed.

The element `eusr:FullSet/eusr:SendingOrReceivingEndUsers` contains the overall number of distinct end users that
have either sent or received datasets. Only values &ge; 0 are allowed.

.Example of a `FullSet` element with 9 sending, 4 receiving and 12 sending or receiving end users:

The following non-normative diagram shows an overview of the theoretical concept of sets behind End User Statistics.
Each shape represents a group of end users.
The Full Set is comprised from the outer green and blue shapes.
The overlapping part of green and blue indicate the end users that did send *and* receive.
The orange shape indicates the subset of end users that deals with invoices - this effects both sending and receiving end users.
The inner yellow shape indicates the subset of end users that deals with invoices from Finland (FI) to Germany (DE) and hence is a subset of the orange shape.

NOTE: The above figure only shows a few selected sets and does not reflect a full breakdown of all possible sets. 


Non-normative example how these values are meant to be calculated:

* End User "A" sent 2 Invoices and 3 Orders
* End User "A" received 5 Invoices
* End User "B" sent 6 Invoices
* End User "C" sent 15 Invoices
* End User "D" received 2 Orders
* End User "E" sent nothing and received nothing

-> The value of `eusr:SendingEndUsers` is `3` (A, B and C)

-> The value of `eusr:ReceivingEndUsers` is `2` (A and D)

-> The value of `eusr:SendingOrReceivingEndUsers` is `4` (A, B, C and D)
