== Introduction

Statistical reporting of production data helps the Peppol Coordinating Authority and PAs to monitor the operations of the Peppol Network and identify and manage risks and issues within the network.
The reporting requirements towards SPs are divided into two areas: reporting about End User data and reporting about Transaction Statistics. This operational procedure will explain and outline the operational procedures for each of these reporting areas.
The policy on reporting is stated in Internal Regulations for Use of the Peppol Network.

=== End User Reporting

==== Process Overview

The following diagram provides an overview of the key steps when Service Providers are reporting monthly End User Data. The diagram is a general representation of the process flow; some steps can be undertaken in parallel and do not need to be completed in strict order.
