* *Service Provider (SP) reporting*
    - how SPs are to submit reports on their End Users and statistical reports on transactions to the Peppol Coordinating Authority. 
* *Peppol Authority (PA) access* 
    - how PAs can access and download the information from the Peppol Coordinating Authority.
* *Peppol Coordinating Authority reports* 
    - how the Peppol Coordinating Authority will make consolidated statistical reports available for public consumption.

* *PA usage* - how PAs will use and share statistical information/reports is managed by each PA.
* *Local or regional domains* - reporting of information for activities within local or regional domains is the responsibility of the PAs owners of those domains. Local and regional domains are required to keep the Peppol Coordinating Authority informed of its activities.
* *Operational reports* - Management reports relating to workloads and workflow (e.g. change requests, extended use requests, issues and incidents, non-compliance, etc.) are managed by the OpenPeppol Operating Office as part of its operations.

== Introduction

Statistical reporting of production data helps the Peppol Coordinating Authority and PAs to monitor the operations of the Peppol Network and identify and manage risks and issues within the network.
The reporting requirements towards SPs are divided into two areas: reporting about End User data and reporting about Transaction Statistics. This operational procedure will explain and outline the operational procedures for each of these reporting areas.
The policy on reporting is stated in Internal Regulations for Use of the Peppol Network.

The OO will:

1.	Receive End User Reports from Service Providers in accordance with the Peppol End User Report specification.
