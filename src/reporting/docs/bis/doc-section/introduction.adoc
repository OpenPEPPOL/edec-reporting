= Introduction

Statistical reporting of production data helps the Peppol Coordinating Authority and PAs to monitor the operations of the Peppol Network and identify and manage risks and issues within the network.
The reporting requirements towards SPs are divided into two areas: reporting about End User data and reporting about Transaction Statistics. This operational procedure will explain and outline the operational procedures for each of these reporting areas.
The policy on reporting is stated in Internal Regulations for Use of the Peppol Network.


== Preface

This Peppol Reporting provides a set of specifications for implementing a Peppol business process. The document is concerned with clarifying requirements for ensuring interoperability of pan-European Public eProcurement and provides guidelines for the support and implementation of these requirements.

The purpose of this document is to describe the use of the End User Reporting and Transaction statistics messages in PEPPOL, and to facilitate an efficient implementation and increased use of electronic collaboration regarding the billing process based on these formats.
